## üí° Introduction
Brain tumors are a critical health concern that affects thousands of lives globally. Identifying whether a brain tumor is **benign** or **malignant** is crucial for determining treatment options. This project provides an automated solution for detecting and classifying brain tumors using **MRI image analysis**.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Models**: CNN, ANN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and MobileNetV2.
- **Wavelet Transformation**: Used for feature extraction to capture fine details from the MRI images.
- **Data Augmentation**: Involves rotation, brightness adjustment, and horizontal flipping of images to create a robust training set.

## üîß Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images are rescaled and normalized using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`. Pixel values are divided by 255, and additional transformations (rotation, brightness) are applied.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Helps in preventing overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Wavelet transformation is applied to extract essential features from the MRI images.
4. **Model Training**:
   - **CNN**: Used to capture spatial hierarchies in the MRI data.
   - **SVM**: A classical machine learning approach that works well for high-dimensional data.
   - **Logistic Regression**: A simpler, interpretable model that serves as a baseline.
   - **MobileNetV2**: A pre-trained model fine-tuned for brain tumor detection, providing a balance between performance and computational efficiency.
5. **Visualization**: Pie charts and bar graphs visualize data distribution across different tumor classes.

## üìä Results
The model achieved the following accuracy rates on the testing data:
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: 31.64%
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: 87.5%
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: 87.4%
- **Logistic Regression**: 82.85%
- **ANN + MobileNetV2**: üèÜ **90.2%**

MobileNetV2, combined with ANN, achieved the highest accuracy due to its pre-trained weights and efficient feature extraction capabilities.

## üìö Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of **AI in healthcare** by showing how **deep learning** and **pre-trained models** can enhance medical diagnostics. The use of **MobileNetV2** significantly boosted accuracy, proving the importance of transfer learning in medical image analysis.

Continued innovation in AI models will play a key role in improving diagnostic accuracy and supporting medical professionals in their decision-making processes.
